The first step to supporting Multi-Tenancy in your application is implementing some form of tenant selection. This could be to resolve the tenant via a DNS subdomain, or it could be part of your applications registration process if you are using authentication with Spring Security.

To keep things simple for the example we are going to implement a simple mechanism that provides a UI to store the `tenantId` within the users HTTP session.

First create a new `ManufacturerController` use `create-controller` or your preferred IDE:

[source,bash]
----
$ grails create-controller Manufacturer
----

Next modify the `UrlMappings.groovy` file to map the root of the application to the `index` action:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/example/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/controllers/example/UrlMappings.groovy[tag=home, indent=0]
----

Then define an `index` action that lists of all the Manufacturers and renders the `grails-app/views/index.gsp` view.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/example/ManufacturerController.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/controllers/example/ManufacturerController.groovy[tag=packageDeclaration]
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/controllers/example/ManufacturerController.groovy[tag=importStatements]
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/controllers/example/ManufacturerController.groovy[tag=classDeclaration]
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/controllers/example/ManufacturerController.groovy[tag=index]
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/controllers/example/ManufacturerController.groovy[tag=closeBracket]
----

Within the `grails-app/views/index.gsp` file, simply iterate through each result and create a link to the `select` action

[source,xml]
.grails-app/views/index.gsp
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/views/index.gsp[tag=iterateManufacturers, indent=0]
----

The `select` action, selects the current tenant and stores the tenant within the current user's HTTP session:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/example/ManufacturerController.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/controllers/example/ManufacturerController.groovy[tag=select, indent=0]
----

<1> Fetches a Manufacturer identified by the supplied `id`
<2> The selected tenant is stored within a session attribute.


The `select` action will find a `Manufacturer` and store the name of the `Manufacturer` (in lower case so it corresponds to a configured data source) as the current tenant within the HTTP session.

This causes link:{gormapi}/org/grails/datastore/mapping/multitenancy/web/SessionTenantResolver.html[SessionTenantResolver] to resolve the correct tenant id from the HTTP session.

Finally, to improve error handling you can map every occurrence of `TenantNotFoundException` to redirect back to the list of manufacturers:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/example/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/controllers/example/UrlMappings.groovy[tag=noTenant, indent=0]
----

With these changes in place you will able to select each tenant from the homepage:

Now that it is possible to select a tenant, lets create a logic that is able to use the currently active tenant.
