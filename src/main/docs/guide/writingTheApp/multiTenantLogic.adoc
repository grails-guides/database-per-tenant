One of the challenges with regards to building an application that uses a unique database connection per tenant is that you have the manage multiple persistence contexts in a scalable manner.

It would not scale to bind a Hibernate session for each and every tenant to each request that came into the application, so you have to be able to write logic that takes into account the fact that the Hibernate session you are using to access the current tenant's data is not currently bound to the current controller action's execution.

To make this challenge simpler GORM features a set of link:{gormapi}/grails/gorm/multitenancy/package-summary.html[Multi-Tenancy transformations] including:

.Multi Tenancy Transformations
|===
| Type | Description

|link:{gormapi}/grails/gorm/multitenancy/CurrentTenant.html[CurrentTenant]
|Resolves the current tenant and binds a Hibernate session for the scope of the method

|link:{gormapi}/grails/gorm/multitenancy/Tenant.html[Tenant]
|Resolves a specific tenant and binds a Hibernate session for the scope of the method

|link:{gormapi}/grails/gorm/multitenancy/WithoutTenant.html[WithoutTenant]
|Execute some logic within a method without a tenant present

|===

These should generally be applied to services in a Grails application and they work really well when combined with the link:{gormdocs}#dataServices[GORM Data Services] concept introduced in GORM 6.1.

To implement the logic to save and retrieve `Vehicle` instances create a new `grails-app/services/example/VehicleService.groovy` file and annotate it within the link:{gormapi}/grails/gorm/multitenancy/CurrentTenant.html[CurrentTenant] and link:{gormapi}/grails/gorm/services/Service.html[Service] annotations:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/example/VehicleService.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-app/services/example/VehicleService.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]
}
----
<1> The link:{gormapi}/grails/gorm/services/Service.html[Service] transformation will ensure any abstract methods that can be implemented by GORM are implemented
<2> The link:{gormapi}/grails/gorm/multitenancy/CurrentTenant.html[CurrentTenant] transformation will ensure any method that is executed on the service resolves the current tenant first and binds a Hibernate session for the resolved database connection.

NOTE: The class is `abstract` because many of the methods will be implemented for you by GORM.


Now lets take a look at how to implement querying logic for a Multi-Tenant application.
